# Inter-Map-Web
It is a university project aiming to create a fullstack single-page application with an interactive map of the historical market. It uses ```react router``` for routing the pages.
There are 2 main pages: Main and Map. The last one is a map with 3D-models of buildings which users can interact with. Every model has its own data with historical information
which is shown to users. All the data is stored in a ```MongoDB``` database. The project is not complited yet.
